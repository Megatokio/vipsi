h3		BOOK: Create Online Books

p		Based on the <i>TEXT.vl</i> and <i>HTML.vl</i> library this library
		serves 95% of all required to create an online documentation as this
		one. For each documentation you need your documentation sources, and a
		script which wraps it all, which i happen to call <i>automate.vs</i>.
		I'll add the very script used for this documentation after the
		<i>BOOK.vl</i> listing.

p		The wrapper script includes <i>BOOK.vl</i>, then adjusts some of the
		settings, adds some individual handlers and then calls <tt>Doit()</tt>
		which should do it. ;-)

p		For that you can get a thought of how the documentation sources look
		like, i'll finally include the source for this chapter.
