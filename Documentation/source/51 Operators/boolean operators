h3  Boolean Negation "!"
	boolean not, logical not, negation, not

pre
	<number> = <b>!</b><number>

p
	Boolean / logical negation.
p
	If the argument number is evaluated as <i>true</i> (non-zero) or <i>false</i> and then this boolean value is negated, resulting in '0' or '1'.
p
	If the supplied value is a text, then it is automatically evaluated as a number.
p
	e.g.:
pre
	if !exists(boo) log "variable boo is missing" then;




h3  Boolean And "&&"
	logical and, and

pre
	<number> = <number> <b>&&</b> <number>

p
	Boolean / logical 'and'.
p
	Determine boolean 'and' of two numeric values. Numbers are considered 'true' if they are non-zero, 'false' otherwise.
p
    Pruning: if the result is sufficiently determined by the left-side operand, that is, if it is <i>0</i> and therefore the result must be <i>0</i>, then the right-side operand is simply skipped and not executed at all.
p
	If any of both arguments is a text, then it is evaluated as number.
p
	List expansion is not yet implemented. (Version 0.8.7)
p
   e.g.:
pre
	if (a==0 && a!=0) log "this can not happen" then;





h3  Boolean Or "||"
	logical or, or

pre
	<number> = <number> <b>||</b> <number>

p
	Boolean / logical 'or'.
p
	Determine boolean 'or' of two numeric values. Numbers are considered 'true' if they are non-zero, 'false' otherwise.
p
    Pruning: if the result is sufficiently determined by the left-side operand, that is, if it is <i>1</i> and therefore the result must be <i>1</i>, then the right-side operand is simply skipped and not executed at all.
p
	If any of both arguments is a text, then it is evaluated as number.
p
	List expansion is not yet implemented. (Version 0.8.7)
p
   e.g.:
pre
	if (a==0||a!=0) log "this is always true" then;
