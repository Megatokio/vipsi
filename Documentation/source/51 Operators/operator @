h3  Make Identifier "@"
	identifier from text, text to identifier
	name from text, text to name
	name, at, idf, identifier

pre
	<name> = @<text>

p
	Returns the text value converted to a name.
p
	Names are identifiers for variables and procedures and some special functions like <tt>convert</tt>. Using operator <tt>@</tt> it is possible to calculate names for variables etc. at runtime.

p
   e.g.:
pre
	var a=1;
	var theName="a";
	put @theName;

	var tabWidth=4
	convert myText to @(tab#tabWidth)

p
	All monadic operators have highest operand binding but operator <tt>@</tt> tops them all. If you want to pass a calculated expression to this operator it's best that you always use parenthesis.
p
	e.g.:
pre
	wrong:
		var @"aaaaaaaaaaa"[to 3] = 77
	right:
		var @("aaaaaaaaaaa"[to 3]) = 77
p
	The above example defines a variable named 'aaa'. The first version does not work, because operator <tt>@</tt> has an even higher priority than range selector <tt>[]</tt>. Therefore the first example evaluates to:
pre
		var (@"aaaaaaaaaaa")[to 3] = 77
	=>
		var aaaaaaaaaaa[to 3] = 77
p
	which is not what you meant and, lucky enough, syntactical nonsense, so that the parser complains with an error.

p
	In general the operator <tt>@</tt> is not recommended for beginners.
