h3  Pre- and Postincrement "++"
	pre increment, post increment
	preincrement, postincrement

pre
	<number> = ++<num_var>
	<number> = <num_var>++

p
	Pre- or post-increment a numeric variable.
p
	Preincrement increments the variable by 1 and then returns the incremented value as result.
p
	Postincrement increments the variable by 1 but returns the not-yet incremented value as result.
p
	If the target variable is a text, then it is converted to a number first.
p
	If the target variable is a list, then the operation is performed on all items. Recursively.
p
   e.g.:
pre
	var i=0; do while i<10; put i++; loop





h3  Pre- and Postdecrement "--"
	pre decrement, post decrement
	predecrement, postdecrement

pre
	<number> = --<num_var>
	<number> = <num_var>--

p
	Pre- or post-decrement a numeric variable.
p
	Predecrement decrements the variable by 1 and then returns the decremented value as result.
p
	Postdecrement decrements the variable by 1 but returns the not-yet decremented value as result.
p
	If the target variable is a text, then it is converted to a number first.
p
	If the target variable is a list, then the operation is performed on all items. Recursively.
p
   e.g.:
pre
	var i=10; do while i>0; put --i; loop
