h3  Add "+"
	addition, plus, plus sign

pre
	<number> = <number> <b>+</b> <number>
	<number> = <b>+</b> <number>

p
	Add two numeric values.
p
	Add two numeric values or text values, which are converted to numbers, results in a number. If one operand is a list, the result is a list, where the operation was applied to all items. If both are lists, they should match in size and the operation is applied to all matching items.
p
	e.g.:
shell
	i> 4+5  o> = 9
	i> put {4,5}+3  o> = { 7, 8 }
	i> put {2,3}+{4,5}  o> = { 6, 8 }
	i> <>

h6	Monadic operator "+"
p
	Superfluxous operator which complements the '<tt>-</tt>' monadic operator.
p
	e.g.:
shell
	i> +(2*3)  o> = 6
	i> <>
p
	Note: preceding a text value with operator '<tt>+</tt>' converts it to a number.
shell
	i> istext("2")  o> = 1
	i> istext(+"2")  o> = 0
	i> isnumber(+"2")  o> = 1
	i> <>



h6	Other usage

p
	'<tt>+</tt>' is also used as a (optional and rarely used) positive number sign for number literals.
p
	e.g.:
pre
	+123, +$affe, +"0123", +"$affe"







h3  Subtract "-"
	sub, minus, minus sign

pre
	<number> = <number> <b>-</b> <number>
	<number> = <b>-</b> <number>

p
	Subtract two numerical values.
p
	Subtract two numeric values or text values, which are converted to numbers, results in a number. If one operand is a list, the result is a list, where the operation was applied to all items. If both are lists, they should match in size and the operation is applied to all matching items.
p
	e.g.:
shell
	i> 9-5  o> = 4
	i> put {4,5}-3  o> = { 1, 2 }
	i> put {4,5}-{2,3}  o> = { 2, 2 }
	i> <>


h6	Monadic operator "-"
p
	Complements the number sign of a value.
p
	e.g.:
shell
	i> -(2*3)  o> = -6
	i> <>
p
	Note: preceding a text with operator '<tt>-</tt>' converts it to a number.
shell
	i> istext("2")  o> = 1
	i> istext(-"2")  o> = 0
	i> isnumber(-"2")  o> = 1
	i> <>


h6	Other usage

p
	'<tt>-</tt>' is also used as a negative number sign for number literals.
p
	e.g.:
pre
	put -123, -$affe, -"0123", -"$affe"
