p	<b>Note:</b> Bitwise operators work on 64 bit integers. If you need less, you must mask the result.

p	Depending on the floating point format selected when compiling vipsi, the precision may be less than 64 bit. 53 bit is common for 8-byte-floats. 

p	Negative numbers are taken by their -1 complement, which is common for integer numbers.

p	If both arguments of a bitwise operation are positive, then the result is positive too in all cases.
	If one or both are negative, this depends on the operator, though it's quite simple: If the result is negative in an infinite-wide integer, the result of the operator is negative; e.g. <b><i>+a^-a</i></b> is negative.
