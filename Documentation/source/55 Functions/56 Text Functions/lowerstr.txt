h3	lowerstr
	lowercase

pre
	<text> = <b>lowerstr</b> ( <text> )
	<text> = <b>lowerstr</b> <text>

p
	Convert <text> to all lowercase characters.
p
	Currently works with all unicode characters in range [0 ... $FFFF]. There are a few ones beyond, which are not yet converted.
p
	As with all functions which take exactly one argument, the parenthesis may be omitted, if the argument is a simple value and no expression with operators.

p   e.g.
pre
    lowerstr "Hello World!"    = "hello world!"
    lowerstr("Hello"#"World!") = "helloworld!"
