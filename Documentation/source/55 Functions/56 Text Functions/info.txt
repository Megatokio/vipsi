	e.g.:

shell
	i> put nl,info("do")

	There is also a <i>shell immediate command</i> <tt>info</tt> which prints the text.

	In order to call function <tt>info</tt> in the shell, you must prevent that <tt>info</tt> is recognized as the shell immediate command. This can be done by not starting in column 1, e.g. prepending a space or ";", or by using <tt>put</tt> just like you had to do in a script.
