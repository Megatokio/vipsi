h3  charstr

pre
    <text> = <b>charstr</b> <number>
    <text> = <b>charstr</b> ( <number> )
p
   convert <number> to <text>. <number> is a unicode character code and the returned <text> is a string containing that character.
p
	As with all functions which take exactly one argument, the parenthesis may be omitted, if the argument is a simple value and no expression with operators.

p   e.g.:
pre
	charstr 8364 = "â‚¬"
