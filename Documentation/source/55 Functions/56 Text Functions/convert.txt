h3  convert

pre
	<text> = <b>convert</b> ( <text> to|from <encoding> )

p
	Convert text from or to named encoding.
p
	The <encoding> must be a name, not a text value. That means: just write the nickname here. The converted text is returned as result.

p
	e.g.:
pre
	mytext = convert( mytext to printable );
    mytext = convert( mytext to mac_roman );
    mytext = convert( mytext from html );
    put "http://", convert(mytext to url)

p
	If you need calculated encodings, you may use operator <tt>@</tt> to convert a text to a name:
pre
	var myEncoding = "tab4"
	myText = convert( myText to @(myEncoding) );
