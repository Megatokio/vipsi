pre
	<text> = <b>file</b> <filename>
	<text> = <b>file</b> ( <filename> )

p
	Read file.
p
	Read file <filename> in binary mode. Returns a <text> value. All character codes are in range 0 ... 255. You should convert character encoding afterwards manually with the function or instruction <tt>convert</tt>, most likely from utf8.
p
	As with all functions which take exactly one argument, the parenthesis may be omitted, if the argument is a simple value and no expression with operators.
p
	There is also an instruction <tt>file</tt> which writes to a file.
p
	e.g.
pre
	var myText = file "~/.myPrefs/rcData"
	convert myText from utf8
	...
	convert myText to utf8
	file "~/.myPrefs/rcData" = myText
