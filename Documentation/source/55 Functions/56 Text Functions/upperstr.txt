h3  upperstr
	uppercase

pre
	<text> = <b>upperstr</b> ( <text> )
	<text> = <b>upperstr</b> <text>

p
	Converts <text> to all uppercase characters.
p
	Currently works with all unicode characters in range [0 ... $FFFF]. There are a few ones beyond, which are not yet converted.
p
	As with all functions which take exactly one argument, the parenthesis may be omitted, if the argument is a simple value and no expression with operators.

p   e.g.
pre
    upperstr "Hello World!"    = "HELLO WORLD!"
    upperstr("Hello"#"World!") = "HELLOWORLD!"
