h3	env

pre
	<list> = <b>env</b>

p
	Returns a list with all environment variables. Each item in this list is named after the environment variable's name and the text value contains the environment variable's data. Environment variables are always text.
p
	There is also a shell immediate command	<tt>env</tt> which prints a beautified listing of the environment variables, similar to the listing generated by the the following example script:

pre
	var env
	var i=0
    do
        while ++i <= count env
		var Data = env[i]
		convert Data from utf8		// rarely really required
		convert Data to quoted		// quote and escape text
		var Name = name env[i]
        put Name, spacestr(20)[count Name to], " = ", Data[to 50], nl
    loop
