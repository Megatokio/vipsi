h3	this
pre
	<list_ref> = <b>this</b>
p
	Return a reference to the list variable which contains the current procedure.
p
	This function must only be executed inside procedures. It returns a reference to the list which contains the procedure.
p
	Normally a variable is searched in the current <tt>privates</tt> context, walking up to the topmost <tt>locals</tt> list of the procedure. Then the enclosing list, which contains the procedure, is scanned. At last the interpreter searches the <tt>globals</tt> list.
p
	So normally it is not neccessary to use <tt>this</tt> to access a 'neighbour' variable.
p
	What is it good for anyway?
p
	The procedure might be locally defined inside another procedure. Then it can easily access all local variables of this procedure too.
p
	Or you put procedures into complicated lists to manage some aspects, offering a light-weight approach to object oriented programming.
p
	e.g.:
pre
	proc Swap(text,Text1,Text2)
	{
		proc Replace(Oldtext,NewText)
		{
			replace text,OldText,NewText
		}

		var z = ")(/&/%&%$ยง&%"
		Replace( Text1, z )
		Replace( Text2,Text1 )
		Replace( z, Text2 )
	}

				Again = now + Delay
				Index %= 4
