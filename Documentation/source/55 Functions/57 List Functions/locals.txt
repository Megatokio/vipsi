h3	locals
pre
	<list_ref> = <b>locals</b>
p
	Return a reference to the local variables list.
p
	This is useful if you want to access unnamed arguments in a procedure with a variable argument list.
p
	e.g.:
pre
	put locals

	proc Test_A ( * )
	{
		var acnt = count locals -1;
		rename locals[1] = style;
		/*
			...
		*/
	}



p
	<tt>locals</tt> is actually also the real name of the local variables list. You can rename it, but you can always access it with <tt>locals</tt>.
