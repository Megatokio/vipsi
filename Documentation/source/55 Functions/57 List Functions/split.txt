pre
	<list> = <b>split</b>( <text> )
	<list> = <b>split</b>( <text> ,<separator> )

	<list> = <b>split</b>( <list> )
	<list> = <b>split</b>( <list> ,<separator> )

p
	Split the text at the given separator and return the resulting list of text chunks. The separator must be a text value and may be a single character or any longer text. It is removed and not preserved when splitting a line.
p
	If no separator is given, then the text is split at any character which looks like a line break: char(0), char(10), char(13) and char(10)+char(13).
p
	If <tt>split</tt> is passed a list instead of a text value, then it works on all list items. Recursively.
p
	There is also an instruction <tt>split</tt> which stores back the list in the original variable.
pre
	var mytext = file "foob√§r"
	mytext = split mytext		// into lines
	mytext = split mytext, tab	// each line at tabs
