h3	dateval

pre
	<number> = <b>dateval</b> <text>
	<number> = <b>dateval</b> ( <text> )

p
	Convert	readable date <text> to numeric time value.

p
	Returns a numeric value in Greenwich Mean Time UTC+0:00. The returned time is in seconds and may be fractional. The time base may vary on different systems. On unix systems it is historically the time since Jan.01 1970.
p
	Note: Currently (Version 0.8.7) the returned time value is in local time. This will be fixed. Function <tt>datestr</tt> also still works with the local time, so this is at least consistent.
