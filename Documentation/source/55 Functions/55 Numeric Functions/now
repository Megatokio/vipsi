h3	now

pre
	<number> = <b>now</b>

p
	Return current time as a value.
p
	Return current time in Greenwich Mean Time UTC+0:00. The returned time is in seconds and is fractional. The time base may vary on different systems. On unix systems it is historically the time since Jan.01 1970.
p
	Note: Currently (Version 0.8.7) the returned time is the local time. This will be fixed. Function <tt>datestr</tt> also still works with the local time, so this is at least consistent.
p
	e.g.

pre
	put "current date and time = ", datestr(now), nl;
	var	a=0, t0=now;
	do while ++a<100000; loop;
	put	"time=", now-t0;
