h3	mdate

pre
	<number> = <b>mdate</b> <path>

p
	Get	the modification date of a file or directory.
p
	Returns a numeric value.
p
	The path must be a text value and may be a full or partial path or start with "~" for the user's home directory. Symbolic links are followed. The path must exist or <tt>mdate</tt> aborts with an error, which may be caught with <tt>try</tt>.
p
	Returns modification time in Greenwich Mean Time UTC+0:00. The returned time is in seconds and is fractional. The time base may vary on different systems. On unix systems it is historically the time since Jan.01 1970.
p
	Note: Currently (Version 0.8.7) the returned time is the local time. This will be fixed. Function <tt>datestr</tt> also still works with the local time, so this is at least consistent.
