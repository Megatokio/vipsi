h1	Constants


h3	ec

p   Euler's constant:
pre
	e = 2.718281828459045

	f'(x)=f(x)  <=>  f(x)=exp(e,x)



h3  pi

p   Natural constant:
pre
	π = 3.141592653589793

p	Circumference of circle:
pre
	radians * 2 * π

p   e.g.:
shell
	i> put "sin(180°) = ", sin(pi); o> sin(180°) = 1.2246063538224e-16
	i> <>


h3  nl

p   Text constant for 'line break'.
	e.g.:
shell
	i> put "hello!", nl;  o> hello!
	o>
	i> <>


h3  tab

p   Text constant for 'tabulator'.
	e.g.:
shell
	i> put nl, "foo =", tab, "bär";
	o> foo =   bär
	i> <>



h3  stdin

p   Constant for the standard input stream: <tt>0</tt>. This is the default stream for the instruction 'get'.
p   e.g.:
pre
	get foo
	get #stdin, foo		// just the same.

	put #stdin, "your choice: "
	get #stdin, wahl

h5	redirect stdin
pre
	openin #stdin, "autoInput.txt"
p
	When doint this in the vipsi shell, you won't get locked out. For your security command input is always read from the original stdin. Only subsequent get, read etc. read from the redirected stdin.


h3  stdout

p   Constant for the standard output stream: <tt>1</tt>. This is the default stream for the instruction 'put'.
p   e.g.:
pre
	put foo
	put #stdout, foo	// just the same
	log #stdout, foo	// makes 'log' printing to stdout too

h5	redirect stdout
pre
	openout #stdout, "mitschrift.txt"




h3  stderr

p   Constant for the standard error stream: <tt>2</tt>. this is the default stream for the instruction 'log'.
p   e.g.:
pre
	log foo
	log #stderr,foo		// just the same
	put #stderr,foo		// make 'put' printing to stderr too

h5	redirect stderr
pre
	openout #stderr, "Fehlerprotokoll.txt"
p
	Version 0.8.8: the redirected stderr is not yet passed to external programs which were called with sys or the like.
