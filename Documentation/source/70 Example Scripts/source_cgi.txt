h3	Online Chat
p	Some months ago i was thinking of adding a chat window to my web site. Time has passed by and the script is now probably disfunct, but may serve as a base for own work.

h3	Search Site

p	This is the script which i use for the "Seach Site" form on <http://little-bat.de>. You will have to adapt some paths and it is, like all my cgi scripts, complicated by the fact, that i use it for two different sites without modification. So there is some path-fiddleing in there. It also contains a 'show-my-source' part.

h4	Test link
p.c	The test link searches the local copy of little-bat.de for the occurance of any word you like:
	<form style="display:inline;" action="/cgi-bin/search.cgi" method="post"><b>Search Site</b> &nbsp; <input type="text" name="pattern" value="" size="14"> &nbsp; <input type="submit" value="Go"></form>

h3	Print Environment

p	One of the most basic scripts used everywhere. Now also available as a vip script. It shows the command line arguments, cgi arguments, environment variables and lists some bin directories.

h3	Online Z80 Assembler

p	One of my other projects is the Z80 assembler zasm, a command line tool for Unix-style operating systems. For some nice people, which use other OS'es, i have set up an online interface to the assembler. This is the cgi script for that.

h3	Show Beautified Folder Listings

// ***note*** Das ist eine kastrierte Form des Scripts.

p	As you may have noticed, i export most of my hard disk to the web. In order to present my stuff nicely, i wrote a cgi script to replace the default folder listing of the Apache web server. Whenever you see a folder listing on my site, with the little bat in the top-left corner, it is generated by this script.

h4	Test link
p.c	The following link leads to the directory with images used by this documentation which should be served to you by this index.cgi script. Depending on the location if this copy of the vipsi documentation this may not be true. B-)
p.c	<a href="b/">/cgi-bin/index.cgi</a>

h3	Sort-of-a Shell

p
	Once upon a time i was in need to have shell access on a web server, but i had none. Actually i wanted to build vipsi on that host. I had an old version running there but utterly wanted to update to the current version.
p
	So i wrote a sort-of-a-shell cgi script to execute some commands. It actually worked better than i dared to hope. Basic thing is, you need a vip script interpreter running

p.c	erm, sorry, no test link. Im a nice gui, but actually not that nice. ;-)
