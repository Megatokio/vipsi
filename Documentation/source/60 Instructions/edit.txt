h3  edit

pre
	<b>edit</b> <variable>
	<b>edit</b> #<number>, <variable>

p
	Edit (write and re-read) data in text format.
p
	<tt>edit</tt> only works with TTYs. Using <tt>edit</tt> on another kind of stream yields an error.
p
	Default stream is <i>stdin</i>. The stream may be changed with #<number>. Default text encoding is UTF-8 unicode. Edit finishes with end of line (return) for each variable.
p
	Reading from a tty (terminal) uses the line editor. Input is colorized according to the settings for <i>stdin</i>. Data presentation is the same as for <tt>put</tt>. The tty must emulate a <i>VT100</i> terminal.
p
	Currently (version 0.8.8) <tt>edit</tt> converts all variables to text.
p
	Text output to a tty is colorized by vipsi to make it unique for stdin, stdout and stderr:
pre
	<span class=in>This is text written / echoed to stdin</span>
	<span class=out>This is text written to stdout</span>
	<span class=err>This is text written to stderr</span>
p
	The color and attributes are choosen to hopefully match the capabilities of your terminal and can be overridden by preferences in <i>~/.vipsi/shell.prefs</i>:

include libs/shell.prefs
