p
	Delete and forget variable, file, link or directory.
p
	Use the special argument <tt>*</tt> to delete all variables and procedures inside the current context, e.g. within the current procedure, local (private) context or really all global variables.
p
	<tt>del</tt> can also be used to delete individual items in lists.

p   e.g.:
pre
	del a, b[1], c.wert, file "trashfile"

	del *

p
	<tt>del</tt> fails with an error if the addressed item does not exist or is of wrong type. You can catch this error with <tt>try</tt> though. Or verify the existence with <tt>exists</tt> beforehand.

p
	The <filename> must be a text value and may be a full or partial path or may start with '~' for the user's home directory.
p
	<tt>del file</tt> requires the target to be a file or it will fail with an error. A symbolic link is followed.
p
	<tt>del dir</tt> requires the target to be a directory and empty or it will fail with an error. A symbolic link is followed.
p
	<tt>del link</tt> requires the target to be a symbolic link or it will fail with an error. A symbolic link is not followed. Obviously.
