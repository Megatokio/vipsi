	<b>read</b> <variable>
	<b>read</b> #<number>, <variable>

p
	Read text in binary mode.
	Default stream is stdin. The stream may be changed with <i>#number</i>.
p
	Reads from tty (terminal) without echo. No conversion applied. Text is read 'as is', every byte making a character. The destination text variable is filled with data from stream. On timeout, eof or error the text is truncated according to the number of bytes actually read.
p
	You probably should convert the read binary data to text with <i>convert <variable> from utf8</i>.
