h3  convert

pre
	<b>convert</b> <text_var> from|to <encoding>


p
	Convert text from or to named encoding.
p
	The text variable is overwritten with the result of the conversion.
	The <encoding> must be a name, not a text value. This means: just write the nickname here.

p
	e.g.:
pre
	convert mytext to printable;
    convert mytext to mac_roman;
    convert mytext from html;
    put "http://", convert(mytext to url)

p
	If you need calculated encodings, you may use operator <tt>@</tt> to convert a text to a name:
pre
	var myEncoding = "tab" # myTabWidth
	convert myText to @(myEncoding);
