h3  open

pre
	<b>open</b> <filename>
	<b>open</b> #<number>, <filename>

p
	Open file or stream for reading and writing.
p
	Default stream is <i>stdout</i> which should be changed by supplying another stream number with <i>#<number></i>. <filename> must be a text value. The filename can be a full or partial path or can start with '~' for the user's home directory. Though you should not do so, you can open a stream for <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i> even in interactive shell mode. The shell's line editor uses a private copy of <i>stdin</i> so that you are not suddenly left alone in the dark.
