	Execute statements with a "safety net".
p
	If a runtime error occurs, then the program is not aborted with an error message. Instead the program execution resumes after <i>then</i> or, if present, at your error handler after <tt>else</tt>.
p
	In case of an error the variable <i>errorstr</i> is created (if it not already exists) and contains the error message.
p
	Your error handler gets also called if the error occurs deep inside some nested procedure call, if no other error handler catches it before you.

p	e.g.:
pre
	try
		openin #4, "that damn ol' file"
	else
    	log "failed: ", errorstr, nl
	then
