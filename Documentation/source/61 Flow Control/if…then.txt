p
	Execute <statements> only if the <condition> is true.
p
	All conditions must be a numeric values and are considered 'true' if they are non-zero.
p
	If the condition is true, then the statements in the following branch are executed and the program finally jumps to the <tt>then</tt> statement, skipping all optionally present <tt>elif</tt> and <tt>else</tt> branches.
p
	If the condition is false, then this branch is skipped, and all optionally present <tt>elif</tt> conditions are tested in order. The branch of the first <tt>elif</tt> condition which is true is executed and the program finally jumps to the <tt>then</tt> statement, skipping all other <tt>elif</tt> and <tt>else</tt> branches.
p
	If all conditions fail, then the final <tt>else</tt> branch is executed, if present. If no <tt>else</tt> branch is present, then actually no statements between <tt>if</tt> and <tt>then</tt> except for the <tt>elif</tt> instructions are executed at all.

p
	e.g.
pre
	if (a>b) return a; else return b; then;

	if a<0
		put "a is smaller than zero"
	elif a==0
		put "a is exactly zero"
	elif a>0
		put "a is greater than zero"
	else
		put "you caught a NaN"
	then
