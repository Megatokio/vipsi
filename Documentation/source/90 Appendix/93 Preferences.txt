h2	Preferences Files
p
	Default preferences files are installed into <i>/usr/local/lib/vipsi/</i> and every user may store his own preferences in <i>~/.vipsi/</i>. There are 3 different files:

ol
li	<b>shell.prefs</b> used for the interactive vipsi shell
li	<b>script.prefs</b> used for scripts
li	<b>/etc/vipsi.cgi.conf</b> used for cgi scripts

p
	Preferences are read from <i>/usr/local/lib/vipsi/shell.prefs</i> or, if existent, from file <i>~/.vipsi/shell.prefs</i>. The preferences file contains a list literal according to the vip script language and is evaluated similar to function <tt>eval</tt>. Not much preferences can be set yet, most useful is setting colors for stdin, stdout and stderr if you have problems with the default magic.
