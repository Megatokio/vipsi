h3	Curly brackets "{ â€¦ }"
	brackets, braces

p   Curly brackets, or braces, enclose list literals, procedure bodies, and blocks of instructions with a private variable scope.

p
   List literals:
pre
	var a = { 1, 2, 3 }
	var b = { a, a, {1,2}, "abc", zz=proc(){return 22;} }
p
	List <tt>b</tt> contains, among other items, again a list <tt>{1,2}</tt> and a procedure named <tt>zz</tt>.

p
	Procedure bodies:
pre
	proc hello() { put "hello ",env.USER,"!" }
	var u2 = proc() { put "hello vipsi!" }
p
	Line 1 defines a produre variable named <tt>hello</tt>, while line 2 defines a variable <tt>u2</tt> which is immediately assigned an unnamed procedure literal, effectively doing something very similar to line 1. ;-)
p
	Procedures can be defined inside other procedures.


p
	Range of instructions with a private variable scope:
pre
	var a = 22;
	{ var a=0; do; while ++a<=10; put a," "; loop; }
	put a;			// prints 22
p
	Local scopes can be nested.
