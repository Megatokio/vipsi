h3	Semicolon ";"
	semi colon

p
	The semicolon ";" is used to separate statements. It is optional and almost never required by the parser but improves readability of your source.

p
   These following examples are just the same:
p
	Without ";"
pre
	var i=1 do if i>100 exit then i+=i loop put "i = ", i, nl
p
	With ";"
pre
	var i=1; do; if i>100; exit; then; i+=i; loop; put "i = ", i, nl;
p
	Best write it this way, with or without ";":
pre
	var i=1
	do
		if i>100 exit then
		i+=i
	loop
	put "i = ", i, nl




p
	Actually sometimes the semicolon is required.
p
   These two lines are just the same:
pre
	var a = 0; log a; a++; log a;
	var a = 0  log a  a++  log a

p
	On the other hand, these two lines differ!
pre
	var a = 0; log a; ++a; log a;
	var a = 0  log a  ++a  log a
p
	Because the parser does not know about the "evident meaning" of spaces and thus sees:
pre
	var a = 0  log a++  a  log a
p
	(which in this example actually just wouldn't matter. idiotic example, i admit.)
