    class Var           version 0.95        last modified: 21.nov.2001
    ---------

  o This class implements variables e.g. for script interpreter, compiler, assembler, database clients etc.

  o It is supplied as source.
    It has been tested with a test suite, though that does not guarantee anything...
    It compiles with my headers under CodeWarrior 11 on MacOS.
    Adaptions to your MacOS environment my need some minor quirks, e.g. defining types like 'uint'.
    Adaptions to other platforms may additionally require the replacement of some (few!) MacOS toolbox calls.
    class Var requires class String or a class of equivalent functionality.
    
   

    Supported data types
    --------------------

    isVoid:     no data assigned yet
    isNumber:   double float number
    isText:     text strings
    isProc:     executable code (basic support for script subroutines)
    isList:     1-dimensional array or list. Arrays/lists may be nested to any depth.



    Highlights
    ----------

  o All variables may be named and retrieved by name
    including variables within lists by use of dot-separated names.
  
  o Powerfull string operations, based on the class String library
    including transparent memory sharing for string texts.
  
  o Powerfull list/array operations
    including things like sorting and automatic list/array resizing.
    
  o Support for left-sided subslicer in lists/arrays and strings, 
    requiered e.g. for:  a[n..m] = b

  o Support for object oriented programming:
    list/array items may be accessed by name
    list/array item names are preserved during list/array assignments
    list/array items may be executable code (code is shared between multiple instances)
  
  

    Suggested implementation
    ------------------------
    
  o Define one global hook variable as a list. Start with this variable as your current context.
  
        Var* globals = new Var(isList); 
        Var* context = globals;
    
  o Put all global variables in this list, appending new defined variables at the end of the list.

        globals-&gt;Append(new Var(new_vars_name));
  
  o To create a local context, append a lokal hook variable to the current hook variable
    and make it a list and remember it to be your new current hook.

        Var* v = new Var("locals",isList);
        context-&gt;Append(v);
        context = v;
  
  o To search for variables (by name, of course) start in the current context
    and retry with the globals list if you did not find it.
    
        Var* v = context-&gt;FindItem(the_name_to_find);
        if (v==NULL) v = globals-&gt;FindItem(the_name_to_find);
        if (v==NULL) Handle_Var_Not_Found();



    Quirks
    ------

  o For the sake of speed, text strings may be shared. 
    Before overwriting some characters within a string's text buffer, e.g. s[123]='x'; the string must be made writable. 
    This is not neccessary before overwriting the string itself,      e.g. s=&quot;anton&quot;; s=b; or a=LeftString(b,n).
    See class String documentation for details.
    This also applies to text and proc variables and variable names.
    
  o All variables which you put into lists must be allocated with new, because list items are deleted if lists are 
    destroyed or re-assigned new data.



    Member functions - Overview: (simplified)
    -----------------------------------------
    
    (For operations on strings also see the class String documentation!)

  o Var creators
        Var     ( )                             unnamed empty variable; type=isVoid
        Var     ( vtype )                       unnamed empty variable; type=vtype; value=0.0/&quot;&quot;/{}
        Var     ( name, vtype )                 named   empty variable
        Var     ( name, value )                 named   variable from numeric value
        Var     ( name, text )                  named   variable from text

  o Automatic type conversion creators
        Var     ( value )                       unnamed variable from numeric value (float or int)
        Var     ( text )                        unnamed variable from text (String, c-string or pascal-string)

  o Operators
        Var&amp;    operator=   ( qData )           assignment: qData may be Var, text or numeric value, 
                                                source and target may intersect; e.g.: a[n]=a or a=a[n]
 
        Var&amp;    operator[]  ( index )           access item in list variable
       
        Var     operator+   ( qData )           add qData. Works with number, text and list
        Var&amp;    operator+=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        Var     operator-   ( qData )           subtract qData. Works with number and list
        Var&amp;    operator-=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        Var     operator*   ( qData )           multiply qData. Works with number, text and list
        Var&amp;    operator*=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        Var     operator/   ( qData )           divide qData. Works with number and list
        Var&amp;    operator/=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        Var     operator%   ( qData )           modulo qData. Works with number and list
        Var&amp;    operator%=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;

        bool    operator==  ( qData )           works with all data types and with all mixtures of data types
        bool    operator!=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        bool    operator&gt;   ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        bool    operator&gt;=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        bool    operator&lt;   ( qData )           &quot;&quot;
        bool    operator&lt;=  ( qData )           &quot;&quot;

  o Functions
        void    SetType     ( vtype )           clear variable and set new data type manually
        vtype   GetType     ( )                 querry data type

        Var*    Parent      ( )                 access parent list or NULL if this Var is not within a list
        uint    Index       ( )                 querry own index in parent list or any arbitrary value if not in a list

        String&amp; Name        ( )                 querry variable's name
        void    SetName     ( name )            redefine variable's name
        Var*    FindItem    ( name )            find item or sub-item of any depth in list

        double  Value       ( )                 access contents of numeric variable
        Var&amp;    MaxVar      ( Var&amp; q )          returns reference to bigger variable (any data type mix)
        Var&amp;    MinVar      ( Var&amp; q )          returns reference to smaller variable (any data type mix)

        String&amp; Text        ( )                 access contents of text variable
      - Examples for class String usage:
        uchar&amp;  Text()[index]                   access individual characters (with range check)
        void    Text().MakeWritable()           make text writable (because text is frequently shared)
        
        String&amp; Proc        ( )                 access executable data (by your interpreter or what else)
        
        int     ListSize    ( )                 querry list size
        void    ShrinkToFit ( bool rec )        free spare memory occupied by list, purge trailing void variables in list, opt. recursively

        void    InsertItem  ( index )           insert empty (isVoid) variable; trailing list moves to make room
        void    DeleteItem  ( index )           remove variable; trailing list moves to close room
        void    AppendItem  ( Var )             append variable to list
        void    AppendList  ( Var )             concatenate lists

        void    RSort       ( )                 backward sort list
        Var&amp;    MaxVar      ( )                 find maximum value in list (items may be any type)
        Var&amp;    MinVar      ( )                 find minimum value in list (items may be any type)
        void    ConvertCharset ( destiny )      convert string or all strings within list e.g. to html &deg; 
        String  ListVar     ( bool e, bool n )  create a text listing of the contents of this variable, opt. escaped, opt. with names

  o Misc. Utilities
        String  Escaped     ( text )            replace special chars by escape sequence, e.g.:   a\\bcde
        String  UnEscaped   ( text )            undo escape
        String  Quoted      ( text )            escape text and put it in quotes: &quot;a\\bcde..&quot;
        String  UnQuoted    ( text )            undo quote


                                                &deg;) ConvertCharset() still work in progress
